# Sound Clustering Project

This project focuses on clustering a dataset of **unlabeled sound files** using machine learning techniques. The goal is to group similar sounds together and explore the effectiveness of different clustering methods after reducing the complexity of the audio features.

---

## Project Structure
- **Feature Extraction:**  
  Extracted Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) from each audio file to represent the key features of the sounds.
  
- **Dimensionality Reduction:**  
  Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) to reduce the number of features and make the data easier to visualize.

- **Clustering Algorithms:**  
  Used K-Means and DBSCAN to find natural groupings in the data.
  
- **Evaluation:**  
  Assessed the clustering results using visual inspection and silhouette scores.

---

## Key Findings
- **K-Means** successfully formed clear and well-separated clusters.
- **DBSCAN** struggled to form distinct groups, possibly due to the density of the dataset and sensitivity to parameter settings.
- **Dimensionality reduction was essential** to visualize and understand the high-dimensional audio data.
